# if __name__ == "__main__":
To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.

Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:

- it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then

- it executes all of the code found in the file.

Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the __name__ checks we always see in Python scripts.

## Code Sample
Let's use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work. Suppose the following is in a file called `foo.py`.


```py
print("before import")
import math

print("before functionA")
def functionA():
    print("Function A")

print("before functionB")
def functionB():
    print("Function B {}".format(math.sqrt(100)))

print("before __name__ guard")
if __name__ == '__main__':
    functionA()
    functionB()
print("after __name__ guard")
```

## Special Variables
When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the `__name__` variable.

### When Your Module Is the Main Program

If you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.

```sh
python foo.py
```


the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string `"__main__"` to the `__name__` variable, i.e.

```py
# It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when run as the main program.
__name__ = "__main__" 
```

### When Your Module Is Imported By Another

On the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:

```py
# Suppose this is in some other main program.
import foo
```

The interpreter will search for your `foo.py` file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name `"foo"` from the import statement to the `__name__` variable, i.e.

```py
# It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when it's imported from another module.
__name__ = "foo"
```

## Executing the Module's Code
After the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.

### Always

1. It prints the string `"before import"` (without quotes).

2. It loads the `math` module and assigns it to a variable called `math`. This is equivalent to replacing `import math` with the following (note that `__import__` is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):


```py
# Find and load a module given its string name, "math",
# then assign it to a local variable called math.
math = __import__("math")
```

3. It prints the string `"before functionA"`.

4. It executes the `def` block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called `functionA`.

5. It prints the string `"before functionB"`.

6. It executes the second `def` block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called `functionB`.

7. It prints the string `"before __name__ guard"`.

### Only When Your Module Is the Main Program

8. If your module is the main program, then it will see that `__name__` was indeed set to `"__main__"` and it calls the two functions, printing the strings `"Function A"` and `"Function B 10.0"`.

### Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another

8. (instead) If your module is not the main program but was imported by another one, then `__name__` will be `"foo"`, not `"__main__"`, and it'll skip the body of the `if` statement.

### Always

9. It will print the string `"after __name__ guard"` in both situations.

### Summary

In summary, here's what'd be printed in the two cases:

```
# What gets printed if foo is the main program
before import
before functionA
before functionB
before __name__ guard
Function A
Function B 10.0
after __name__ guard
```

```
# What gets printed if foo is imported as a regular module
before import
before functionA
before functionB
before __name__ guard
after __name__ guard
```

## Why Does It Work This Way?
You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this. Well, sometimes you want to write a `.py` file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself. Examples:

- Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.
- Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing `.py` files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.
- Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.

Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. "Running" the script is a side effect of importing the script's module.

## Food for Thought
- Question: Can I have multiple `__name__` checking blocks? Answer: it's strange to do so, but the language won't stop you.

- Suppose the following is in `foo2.py`. What happens if you say `python foo2.py` on the command-line? Why?

```py
# Suppose this is foo2.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) 

def functionA():
    print("a1")
    from foo2 import functionB
    print("a2")
    functionB()
    print("a3")

def functionB():
    print("b")

print("t1")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("m1")
    functionA()
    print("m2")
print("t2")
```

- Now, figure out what will happen if you remove the `__name__` check in `foo3.py`:

```py
# Suppose this is foo3.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) 

def functionA():
    print("a1")
    from foo3 import functionB
    print("a2")
    functionB()
    print("a3")

def functionB():
    print("b")

print("t1")
print("m1")
functionA()
print("m2")
print("t2")
```

- What will this do when used as a script? When imported as a module?

```py
# Suppose this is in foo4.py
__name__ = "__main__"

def bar():
    print("bar")
    
print("before __name__ guard")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bar()
print("after __name__ guard")
```
